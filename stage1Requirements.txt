Meal Planner Stage 1/6: Add meals
JetBrains Academy project

Add meals

1. Description

	Let's start with something simple. Write a program that can store meals and
	their properties. Prompt users about the category of a meal (breakfast,
	lunch, or dinner), name of a meal, and necessary ingredients. The program
	should print that information with the meal properties in the correct
	format. In this stage, you don't need to validate user input.

2. Objectives

	To complete this stage, your program should:

    Ask about the meal category with the following message: Which meal do you
    want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?;
	
    Ask about the name of the meal with the message Input the meal's name:;
	
    Inquire about the necessary ingredients with the message Input the
    ingredients:. The input contains ingredients in one line separated by
    commas. The output displays each ingredient on a new line (see Examples);
	
    Print all the information about the meal in the following format:

	Print the message that the meal is saved successfully: The meal has been
	added!.
