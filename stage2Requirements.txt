Meal Planner stage 2/6: Create a menu
JetBrains Academy project

Create a menu

1. Description

    One meal is not going to get you far! Let's create the main menu to add
    several meals and display their properties. For this, we need to add a few
    commands:

        Add starts the meal input process and prompts users for the meal
        properties;

        Show prints the list of saved meals with their names, categories, and
        ingredients;

        After executing add or show, the program should ask what users want to
        do next;

        The program must run until users input exit â€” the command that
        terminates the program.

    In this stage, your program should also check the user input. What if users
    enter something wrong?

        If the input meal category is something other than breakfast, lunch, or
        dinner, print Wrong meal category! Choose from: breakfast, lunch,
        dinner. and prompt users for input;

        If the meal's name or ingredients have a wrong format (for example,
        there are numbers or non-alphabet characters; ingredients are blank,
        and so on), print Wrong format. Use letters only! and prompt users for
        input. Meal's name or ingredients containing several words like "peanut
        butter" should not be matched as wrong format.

2. Objectives

    To complete this stage, the program must comply with the following
    requirements:

        Create an infinite loop of your program that can be terminated with the
        exit command only;

        Prompt users to choose an operation with the message What would you
        like to do (add, show, exit)?

        After the command has been processed, ask for another operation;

        Make sure that the input and output formats are correct;

        If users want to add a meal, follow the sequence from the previous
        stage. Don't forget to validate input as explained above. Output The
        meal has been added! before proceeding;

        If users want to show the meals when no meals have been added, print No
        meals saved. Add a meal first. If there are meals that can be displayed,
        print them in the order they've been added, following the format from
        Stage 1;

        Print Bye! and end the program once the exit command is entered;

        If users fail to input a valid command, print the following message
        again: What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
